# AIZON TECHNICAL TEST
## Cypress assessment with Cucumber support


The project requires `npm` and `cypress` correctly installed and updated

```
npm install
cypress install
```
Once the repository is downloaded locally everything is ready to go.
The configuration is already setup to show only the `.feature` files, it is sufficient to run the script:

```
npm run cy:open
```

to open the cypress dashboard, then selecting a browser the test cases will show up.
